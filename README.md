Getting and Cleaning Data 
Week 4 Assignment

Summary of Code:
The R code loads TXT test and training data, combines datasets to perform an analysis by averaging training and test datasets for two variables (mean and standard deviation) by each activity code

Steps for creating output file:
Download the zip files from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Unzip the files to your R working directory
Download the R code titled "run_analysis.R"
Execute the R code to generate text file

Below are the steps performed to create code:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
